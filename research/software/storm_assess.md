### storm_assess is a older python package for working with cyclone track data.  
  
#### Introduction

`storm_assess` is a Python module to read ascii-format output from the *TRACK* and *TempestExtremes* cyclone-tracking algorithms, originally developed by Joanne Camp (Met Office & Bureau of Meteorology). This package has been used in recent publications, but the far more capable [HuracanPy](https://huracanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is now recommended.  

The package is available at [alexanderjbaker/storm_assess](https://github.com/alexanderjbaker/storm_assess) and on JASMIN at: `/gws/nopw/j04/huracan/tools/python/storm_assess/`. A version of `storm_assess`, developed by Malcolm Roberts (Met Office), was developed for reading NetCDF-format track output data (from HighResMIP), which is available [here](https://github.com/PRIMAVERA-H2020/HighResMIP-storm_reader).

#### A simple example: load a *TRACK* output file and plot a pressure–wind relationship

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from storm_assess import track

# Load a list of storms and get the wind speed and central pressure data
track_fn = 'track_filename'
storms = list(track.load(track_fn))
mslp_minima = [storm.mslp_min for storm in storms]
vmax_maxima = [storm.vmax for storm in storms]

# Fit
coeff = np.polyfit(vmax_maxima, mslp_minima, 2.)
poly1d = np.poly1d(coeff)
fit_x = np.linspace(min(vmax_maxima), max(vmax_maxima), len(vmax_maxima))
fit_y = poly1d(fit_x)

# Plot
plt.scatter(vmax_maxima, mslp_minima, color='r', marker='.', alpha=0.5)
plt.plot(fit_x, fit_y, color='r', label='dataset name')
plt.ylabel(r'p$_{min}$')
plt.xlabel(r'v$_{max}$')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Each `storm` object contains attributes that describe the location and additional fields (i.e., wind speed, central pressure etc) for each track. For example:

```python
storm = storms[i]
storm.obs
storm.vmax
storm.mslp_min
storm.obs[t].date
storm.obs[t].lon
storm.obs[t].lat
storm.obs_at_vmax()
storm.obs_at_min_mslp().date
```
